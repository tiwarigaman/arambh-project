                <h2>Origin of The Aarambh</h2>
                <p>The Aarambh provides a free open-source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online.
                    Since its inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and will assist countless
                    others in learning enough programming to work on their own personal projects.

                    Mr. Alok Kumar founded The Aarambh Project in 2023. Currently, it is maintained and continually improved
                    by a team of volunteers, many of whom learned to code with us. Many find success in Aarambh Project's
                    curriculum because of its hands-on approach with learning and emphasis on building projects. The
                    curriculum is meticulously curated to ensure the content is up-to-date.

                    
                </p>

                <h2>Open Source</h2>
                </div>
                <p>This website and the curriculum it hosts are completely open source. That means anyone can work on
                    new features or fix existing bugs on the website. This also extends to the curriculum itself, anyone
                    can work on new lessons, add new resources and improve existing lessons.

                    The Aarambh project would not be possible without the hard work of contributors from all across the
                    world. If you're interested in helping us make Aarambh better please find out how to contribute.</p>
